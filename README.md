# Time-Series-Project
To predict the Bitcoin Prices using Time Series Models

Cryptocurrency is the Decentralized Digital Asset that acts as a store of value as well as a medium of exchange. It is built on Blockchain Technology which uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions.

How do Bitcoin markets behave? What are the causes of the sudden spikes and dips in cryptocurrency values?
Why this Dataset ? 

In recent years, it has been a buzz word and has given multifold growth to it's Investors but unlike other assets it is extremely volatile which makes it the riskiest Investment. This Volatility in prices can be attributed to demand and supply of a particular coin in the market.

**Objective**
The objective of this Project is to Explore Historical Prices of Bitcoin(one of the Cryptocurrencies) and develop a predictive model for prices by leveraging Time Series Analysis, Deep Learning techniques.

**Steps**
1.	Initially,did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to study relations among different variables under study.
2.	Then moved to Time Series with models like ARIMA and ARIMAX.
3.	Then moved towards some Deep learning models like Multi Layer Perceptron to make the final predictions.
